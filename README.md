Currently (2016-10-22), there are problems for letting GitHub to build jekyll
static pages by using the github-pages gem:
https://github.com/jekyll/minima/issues/34 and no support for jekyll 3.3.0.
Branches *jekyll* and *gh-pages* are for using built pages in GitHub pages.
These branches are independent of the *master* branch.
